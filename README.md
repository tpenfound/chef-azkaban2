Description
===========

Installs Azkaban2. http://azkaban.github.io/azkaban2/

Derived from Yieldbot's azkaban2 cookbook (https://github.com/yieldbot/chef-azkaban2) but set up to install Azkaban 2.5 instead of 2.0, set some things for my particular environment (notably, eschew Ironfan), parameterize a few things so I can override them in wrapper cookbooks.

Requirements
============
* Java cookbook version >= 1.5
* MySQL server available and already set up.
* expects keystore to already be set up

Setting up the keystore can be done by executing

`keytool -keystore keystore -alias jetty -genkey -keyalg RSA`

and going through the dialog. See the page below for more information.

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb`.

Usage
=====

* web_server - installs azkaban web server
* executor_server - installs azkaban executor server
* TODO mysql_setup - runs mysql setup scripts
* TODO keystore_setup - would set up keystore
